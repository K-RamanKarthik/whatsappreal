# Creating Extension Icons

You need to create three icon files for the extension:

1. `icons/icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
2. `icons/icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
3. `icons/icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Options:

### Option 1: Use an Online Tool
- Visit https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or https://favicon.io/
- Upload an image or use an emoji (🛡️ or 📱)
- Download the generated icons
- Rename and place them in the `icons/` folder

### Option 2: Create Simple Icons
- Use any image editor (Paint, GIMP, Photoshop)
- Create a square image with a shield icon (🛡️) or WhatsApp green (#25D366) background
- Export at the required sizes

### Option 3: Use Placeholder
For now, you can use any PNG file renamed to the required names - the extension will still work, just won't show custom icons in the browser toolbar.

## Icon Design Suggestions:
- Shield symbol (🛡️) - represents protection
- WhatsApp green (#25D366) background
- White or contrasting color for the shield
- Simple, recognizable design at small sizes
